In this lesson, the different values, data types, and the concept of concatenation will be introduced. Here, you will learn which data type is appropriate for each function. Declaring variables, using boolean logic, and joining strings together for an end result will also be explored."

In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. In using these, we do not need to write the same code again and again."
